I am a PhD student advised by Professor [Shanhui Fan](https://fangroup.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. My research thus far includes designing nanophotonic metamaterials for optical computing and imaging applications, as well as theorizing new physical phenomena using synthetic frequency dimensions.

Before Stanford, I received my A.B. in Physics from Princeton University, with certificates in Engineering Physics and Computer Science (2020). I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Emily Carter](https://carter.princeton.edu/) and awarded the Engineering Physics Thesis Prize upon graduation. In 2023, I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, concentrating in Physical Technology.

I am grateful to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.
