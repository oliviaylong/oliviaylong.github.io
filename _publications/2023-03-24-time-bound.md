The duality of space and time in Maxwell's equations has prompted interest in time boundaries and the accompanying temporal analog of spatial reflection and refraction. However, achieving observable time-boundary effects at optical frequencies in real materials is challenging. In this Letter, we demonstrate that time reflection and refraction can be observed in a two-band model centered around a nonzero reference energy. Our model can be physically implemented in the synthetic frequency dimension as a system of two coupled dynamically modulated ring resonators. We find that modulation at microwave frequencies is sufficient to observe time-boundary effects for optical waves in synthetic frequency dimension. Our Letter shows that implementing multiband models in synthetic dimensions opens a new avenue for further exploration of time boundaries.
