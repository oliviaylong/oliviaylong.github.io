abstract_text: Flat optics has demonstrated great advances in miniaturizing conventional bulky optical elements due to recent developments in metasurface design. Specific applications of such designs include spatial differentiation and the compression of free-space. However, metasurfaces designed for such applications are often polarization-dependent and are designed for a single functionality. In this work, we introduce a polarization-independent metasurface structure by designing guided resonances with degenerate band curvatures in a photonic crystal slab. Our device can perform both free-space compression and spatial differentiation when operated at different frequencies at normal incidence. This work demonstrates the promise of dispersion engineering in metasurface design to create ultrathin devices with polarization-independent functionality.
