Scintillation describes the conversion of high-energy particles into light in transparent media and finds diverse applications such as high-energy particle detection and industrial and medical imaging. This process operates on multiple timescales, with the final radiative step consisting of spontaneous emission, which can be modeled within the framework of quasiequilibrium fluctuational electrodynamics. Scintillation can therefore be controlled and enhanced via nanophotonic effects, which has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Such designs have thus far obeyed Lorentz reciprocity, meaning there is a direct equivalence between scintillation emission and absorption by the scintillator. However, scintillators that do not obey Lorentz reciprocity have not been explored, even though they represent an alternative platform for probing emission, which is both nonequilibrium and nonreciprocal in nature. In this work, we propose to harness nonreciprocity to achieve directional control of scintillation emission, granting an additional degree of control over scintillation. Such directionality of light output is useful in improving collection efficiencies along the directions where detectors are located. We present the design of a nonreciprocal scintillator using a one-dimensional magnetophotonic crystal in the Voigt configuration. Our work demonstrates the potential of controlling nonequilibrium such as scintillation by breaking reciprocity and expands the space of nanophotonic design for achieving such control.
